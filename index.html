            <h1>2019-2020 NBA Top Eastern Conference Contenders</h1>

    </article>

    <div class="intro-paragraph">
        <p>The NBA has experienced quite a shakeup in the Championship scene. More specifically, the Eastern Conference of the league features the world's brightest stars, such as <a href="https://stats.nba.com/player/202695/">Kawhi Leonard</a>, <a href="https://stats.nba.com/player/203507/">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>, and <a href="https://stats.nba.com/player/203954/">Joel Embiid</a>, just to name a few. With new additions via free agency of 2019, the conference has gotten more exciting than ever before. Stay tuned to see my personal top 3 teams to look out for in the upcoming season.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="container-1">
        <h2 class="title-1">1. Toronto Raptors</h2>
        <h3 class="assets-1">Top Assets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kawhi Leonard</li>
            <li>Pascal Siakam</li>
            <li><small>Kyle Lowry</small></li>
        </ul>

        </figure>

        <p>The <sup>2019 NBA Champions</sup> Toronto Raptors are <strong>no doubt</strong> the favourites to win the East once again if Kawhi Leonard chooses to resign. Their deep roster and veteran experience along with the presence and services of NBA superstar Kawhi Leonard puts them over the top to take first place on my list unless competitors drastically change their rosters. <del>#HeStay</del></p>

    <div class="container-2">    
        <h2 class="title-2">2. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
        <h3 class="assets-2">Top Assets</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Joel Embiid</li>
            <li>Ben Simmons</li>
            <li><small>Tobias Harris</small></li>

        </figure>

        <p>The Philadelphia 76ers still harbour a <sup>very</sup> potent starting lineup with Joel Embiid at the helm. Despite losing Jimmy Butler in the offseason, they can still make a strong case for the best starting lineup in the East with newly acquired Al Horford in the <sub>middle.</sub> <q>Trust the Process.</q></p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-3">
        <h2 class="title-3">3. Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
        <h3 class="assets-3">Top Assets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Giannis Antetokounmpo</li>
            <li>Khris Middleton</li>
            <li><small>Eric Bledsoe</small></li>
        </ul>

        </figure>

        <p>The Milwaukee Bucks, despite losing <samp>SG</samp> Malcolm Brogdon over the offseason and <samp>PF</samp> Nikola Mirotic, are still a threat to be reckoned with as they have the services of MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. With the best coach of the conference in Mike Budenholzer, I expect the Bucks to still be competitive. Giannis can already score at will in the paint but if he develops a consistent jumpshot over the summer, the reigning MVP will literally become unstoppable and it will be a <em>scary sight.</em> The clock is ticking for the rest of the league. The 2019-2020 NBA regular season will officially commence <time datetime="2019-10-01 07:00">October at 7:00 PM</time> on ABC.</p>
    </div>

    <main class="personal-thoughts">
        <p>The 2019-2020 NBA season is primed to be the most exciting season yet. With teams actively shuffling rosters to become competitors as well as the Golden State Warriors losing heavy firepower in Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, the season will undoubtedly pan out to be crazy and unpredictable for the first time in years. While the Western Conference still has its own formidable foes in the Warriors, Lakers, Clippers, and Rockets, the East will still be a force to be reckoned with coming into the brand new season.</p>
    </main>

    <section class="final">
        <h4>Final Remarks</h4>
        <p><code>While the Western Conference boasts some of the strongest talents in the league, the Eastern Conference has vastly improved over the years to compete. With superstars emerging in the East, the league has never been more balanced. With Kawhi Leonard leading the east coast, the Toronto Raptors are poised to win another Championship. Like Michael Jordan once said, <blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/444526?ref=nba">Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just illusions.</blockquote></code></p>
